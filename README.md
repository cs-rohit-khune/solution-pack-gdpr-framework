### Introduction

**GDPR Framework Solution Pack** is designed to help users notify a personal data breach to the supervisory authority as per guidelines determined by General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR).

In the case of a personal data breach incident, as mandated in [GDPR Article. 33](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/), the organization must notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours, and the notification must contain the following details:

- Nature of personal data breach
- Contact details of the data protection officer
- Consequences of the personal data breach
- Measures taken or proposed to remediate personal data breach
- Mitigating actions undertaken to minimize the risk

This solution pack provides a set of paybooks that enables users to gather all the necessary information and send it over to supervisory authority in time.
